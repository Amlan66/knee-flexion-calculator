# Knee Flexion Caluculator 

Knee flexion is the action of bending the knee by decreasing the angle between the thigh and lower leg. This motion is essential for many daily activities, such as sitting, squatting, lunging, climbing stairs, and kneeling.

Knee Flexion angle is a measure of the flexion of the knee joint. It is an important parameter in the assessment of knee joint health and function.
Incase of ACL reconstruction, the knee flexion angle is an important parameter to measure the knee flexion range of motion and compare it pre and post acl reconstruction.

Using this tool, people recovering from ACL reconstruction can measure their knee flexion angle and track their progress over time.
